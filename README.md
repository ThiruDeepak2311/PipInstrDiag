Project Overview:-

This project focuses on detecting P&ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram) symbols from schematic images using advanced computer vision (CV) and deep learning (DL) techniques. By leveraging YOLOv8, the SAHI library, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), the system enhances detection performance and accuracy. The detection system is implemented in Streamlit to provide easy accessibility and user interaction.

Features:-

Advanced Detection: Utilizes YOLOv8 and the SAHI library for high-precision P&ID symbol detection.

OCR Integration: Incorporates OCR to accurately recognize and extract text information from schematic images.

User-Friendly Interface: Implemented in Streamlit to provide an accessible and interactive user experience.

Technologies Used:-

YOLOv8: For object detection and classification.

SAHI Library: Enhances the performance and accuracy of object detection.

OCR (Optical Character Recognition): Recognizes and extracts text from images.

Streamlit: Provides an interactive and accessible user interface.
